                  The image has been produced with the intention to use it as a
                  partial background for a section of a webpage. It has,
                  therefore, been neutralized by reducing the contrast so that
                  the possibly overlaying elements would be supported and
                  complimented by it, rather than overwhelmed. In addition, it
                  has been combined with a gradient and exported in a PNG format
                  to retain its transparency, and provide an effect of the image
                  fizzling out rather than finishing on a hard line.

                  This image has been lightened to give it a subtle washed out
                  look, as it was intended to be used in a pairing with another
                  element, possibly including some text. Since the idea has been
                  to use it as a general ‘’map object’’ rather than pointing to
                  any geographical landmarks - in order to retain a sense of
                  universality and timelessness - a lot of the details that were
                  initially clearly visible on the map have been removed.

                  On top of lightening the image to make it bright enough to
                  hold up against a colourful background it might potentially be
                  placed on, I have also used cut outs from additional images of
                  flower drawings. The intention has been to give it a playful
                  collage look, as it is supposed to represent a summer event.
                  The image has also been exported in this specific ratio and
                  dimensions to occupy a spot in a designated event’s area on a
                  webpage.

                <p>
                  This image had it’s colour hues adjusted slightly, to give it
                  a more warm and colourful look. It is intended for the same
                  area of the event listings as the above discussed image 3,
                  hence the same dimensions and ratio. Additionally, the pen in
                  the picture has been contrasted separately in order to make it
                  a clearer, stand-out focus of the image, as the picture has
                  been produced to represent a writing workshop event.

                <p>
                  This image, just like the previous two, with which it shares
                  the same dimensions and ratio, has been produced to represent
                  an event, specifically, a children’s book discussion on the
                  genre of sci-fi. For this reason it strives to appear
                  light-hearted and fun; and the effect of collage elements made
                  to appear as a part of the book cover helps achieve just that.

                <h2>Image 6</h2>
                <p>
                  This last image has been produced digitally by using a crayon
                  method. It has been made with the intent to represent a
                  website in a banner-like fashion. Messy and a tiny bit
                  surreal, it spells out ‘book’. I appreciate the playful
                  dissonance it creates against a stricter structure of a
                  webpage.
